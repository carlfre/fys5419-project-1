## Repo structure
Individual problem solutions are kept in files `problem_{problem number}.py` or `problem_{problem number}.ipynb`. 
The VQE code can be found in `VQE.py` - this file implements VQE for all problems, and writes the solutions to file. Different quantum gates can be found in `gates.py`, and ansatzes can be found in `ansatzes.py`. `utils.py` holds some file reading/writing functionality.
